# 📺 TidyTuesday 2025-07-29 — Netflix Movies & Shows

This repository contains my contribution to the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project for the week of **2025-07-29**, focusing on **Netflix Movies and Shows**.  
The project mainly explores how release timing and availability relate to audience engagement.

## 🔍 Research Questions

The analysis is guided by several core questions:

1. **Viewing Sustainability**
   - Do older shows maintain viewing performance, or do newer releases dominate?  
   - How should “old” be defined (e.g., > 2 years since release)?  
   - Can “sustainability” be measured by the slope of viewership decline?

2. **Release Timing**
   - How does the timing of a show's release (month/season) relate to engagement metrics?  
   - Which engagement metrics matter most (hours viewed, total views, runtime-adjusted views)?

3. **Global vs. Regional Availability**
   - How does the performance of globally available titles compare to regionally restricted ones?  
   - Does “better performance” mean higher viewership, longer watch hours, or other forms of engagement?

4. **Top Performers Across Reports**
   - How do the top movie performers in each reporting period compare?  
   - Are the same kinds of movies consistently popular?

5. **Series Continuity**
   - Do later seasons of popular shows gain, lose, or maintain engagement compared to earlier seasons?  
   - What patterns emerge across multiple engagement reports?

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [TidyTuesday 2025-07-29 — Netflix data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-07-29/readme.md)  
- **Columns**:  
  - Title, Release date, Hours viewed, Runtime, Global availability, etc.  
- Despite having relatively few columns, the dataset can be transformed and recoded into meaningful derived variables for deeper insights.

## 🛠 Methods

- Data wrangling with **tidyverse**  
- Exploratory analysis and visualization in **ggplot2**  
- Feature engineering (e.g., defining sustainability, categorizing release timing)  
- Regression and trend analysis to test hypotheses

## 🚧 Notes

- This project is currently code-only due to time constraints.  
- Textual write-ups and interpretation will be updated later.  
- Even with limited variables, the dataset allows creative exploration and reframing of engagement dynamics.
